# Employer Compliance API
## Architecture & Build Guide
**Version 6.0** · My Virtual Bench LLC · March 2026

A unified B2B enrichment API delivering normalized employer regulatory risk profiles — OSHA, WHD, MSHA, EPA ECHO, FMCSA, OFCCP, NLRB, and OFLC enforcement data — queryable by employer name, address, or EIN. No commercial equivalent exists.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Employer Compliance API is a B2B data enrichment product built on public federal enforcement data. It aggregates inspection and violation records from eight federal sources, normalizes messy establishment names and addresses, resolves records to canonical employer entities, and exposes a clean REST API returning structured compliance risk profiles.

After exhaustive market research across Datarade (560+ categories, 2,000+ providers), YC, Product Hunt, Middesk, Enigma, and Baselayer, no commercial product wraps this enforcement data into an enrichment API. Federato, a $100M-funded underwriting platform, explicitly describes underwriters manually checking osha.gov one employer at a time — confirming both the pain and the absence of a solution.

<!-- v6: deployment architecture clarification -->
The system runs as a **two-server architecture** from day one: a **pipeline server** (nightly ETL, entity resolution, scoring) and an **API server** (FastAPI, pgBouncer, Metabase). Both are **Docker-native** — no bare-metal setup steps, no "we'll containerize later."

### 1.1 Core Value Proposition

- Raw federal enforcement data is free and public. The value is normalization, entity resolution, multi-source synthesis, and a clean API.
- Eight data sources combined: OSHA, WHD, MSHA, EPA ECHO, FMCSA SMS, OFCCP, NLRB, OFLC. No competitor combines them.
- Entity resolution moat: every month of operation adds labeled training pairs and longitudinal history a late entrant cannot reconstruct.
- **Four access modes:** <!-- v6: [finding #38] added webhooks/subscriptions -->
  1. **REST API** — technical buyers, highest ACV.
  2. **Metabase web UI** — non-technical buyers, faster close.
  3. **Bulk export** — data licensing.
  4. **Webhooks / subscriptions** — monitoring mode. Customers subscribe to employer IDs and receive callbacks on risk-tier changes or new violations.
- **Free tier: 5 lookups/month** with no credit card required. Paid tiers for volume. <!-- v6: [finding #41] free tier -->
- Zero marginal infrastructure cost to launch: DuckDB, dbt, Splink, FastAPI, Postgres are all open source.

### 1.2 Target Buyers

| Buyer Segment | Access Mode | Why They Pay |
|---|---|---|
| Insurance underwriters | REST API | Automate employer risk assessment during quoting |
| Staffing / PEO firms | REST API, Metabase | Screen client employers before placement |
| ESG / compliance consultants | Metabase, Bulk export | Portfolio-level risk monitoring |
| Supply-chain compliance | Webhooks, REST API | Monitor vendor compliance status continuously |
| Legal / litigation support | REST API | Discovery and due diligence |

## 3. Database Architecture

Postgres from day one. No SQLite in production, no "migrate later" plan. <!-- v6: [finding #9] -->

The pipeline server writes to Postgres. The API server reads from Postgres through pgBouncer. Both servers run Docker Compose stacks that share the same Postgres instance (or separate instances — your call on infra, but one logical database).

### 3.1 pipeline/db.py

<!-- v6: [finding #9] Replaced SQLite with Postgres. All monitoring goes to pipeline_runs table. -->

### 3.2 Nightly Sync — Shadow-Table Swap

<!-- v6: [finding #1] Replaced TRUNCATE+COPY with shadow-table swap. Zero-downtime refresh. -->
<!-- v6: [finding #3] Replaced CSV intermediate format with direct DuckDB→Postgres binary COPY. -->

The old approach was `TRUNCATE employer_profile; COPY ... FROM csv`. That blocks reads during the load and leaves an empty table if the COPY fails. The v6 approach: **shadow-table swap**.

```sql
-- Step 1: Pipeline writes into a staging table (created fresh each run)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employer_profile_staging;
CREATE TABLE employer_profile_staging (LIKE employer_profile INCLUDING ALL);

-- Step 2: COPY data into staging (binary format, not CSV)
-- From Python: DuckDB writes directly to Postgres via binary COPY protocol
-- No intermediate CSV file touches disk.
COPY employer_profile_staging FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT binary);

-- Step 3: Build indexes on staging BEFORE the swap
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_name ON employer_profile_staging (employer_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_ein ON employer_profile_staging (ein);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_naics ON employer_profile_staging (naics_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_risk ON employer_profile_staging (risk_tier);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_snapshot ON employer_profile_staging (snapshot_date);

-- Step 4: Drop any leftover prev table, then atomic swap
-- v6.1: Retain old table as employer_profile_prev for webhook diff (Step 8).
-- Previous version dropped employer_profile_old immediately, making diff impossible.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employer_profile_prev;
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE employer_profile RENAME TO employer_profile_prev;
ALTER TABLE employer_profile_staging RENAME TO employer_profile;
COMMIT;

-- Step 5: employer_profile_prev is kept alive until AFTER dispatch_webhooks.py (Step 8).
-- dispatch_webhooks.py drops it when done:
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employer_profile_prev;
```

**Python driver for binary COPY (pipeline/sync.py):**

<!-- v6.1: Fixed — previous version claimed "binary COPY" but actually used execute_values (parameterized INSERTs).
     Now uses actual psycopg2 copy_expert with COPY FROM STDIN BINARY protocol for ~5-10x throughput. -->

```python
"""
pipeline/sync.py — Shadow-table swap with DuckDB→Postgres binary COPY.
v6: No CSV intermediate (finding #3). Shadow-table swap (finding #1).
v6.1: Actually uses COPY FROM STDIN (was incorrectly using execute_values).

### 3.3 pgBouncer

pgBouncer sits between the API server and Postgres. Transaction-mode pooling. The API server never connects to Postgres directly.

; TLS (for Metabase or other clients connecting over non-loopback — future-proofing)
; client_tls_sslmode = disable    ; not needed when listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
```

**userlist.txt format** (plaintext passwords, file permissions `chmod 600`):
```
"api" "md5<hash>"
"metabase_user" "md5<hash>"
```
Generate hash: `echo -n "password_hereapi" | md5sum` (md5 of password+username). Or for scram-sha-256, extract the hash from Postgres: `SELECT rolpassword FROM pg_authid WHERE rolname='api';`

> **Firewall note (finding #53):** Even with `listen_addr = 127.0.0.1`, explicitly block port 6432 in your host firewall (`ufw deny 6432` or equivalent). Defense in depth. pgBouncer must never be reachable from the public internet.

### 3.4 Postgres Schema

All tables live in a single `stablelabel` database. Schema is applied by numbered migration files run at deploy time.

<!-- v6.1: Was a single 001_init.sql with no versioning strategy. Now uses a simple
     sequential migration runner with a tracking table — no ORM dependency. -->

**Migration strategy:** Migrations are sequential SQL files in `migrations/` (e.g., `001_init.sql`, `002_add_subscriptions_indexes.sql`). A `schema_migrations` table tracks which migrations have been applied:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    version     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    filename    TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The migration runner (`migrations/migrate.py`) runs at container startup before the app:

```python
# migrations/migrate.py
import os, re, psycopg2

def migrate():
    con = psycopg2.connect(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])
    con.autocommit = False
    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
            version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            filename TEXT NOT NULL,
            applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
        )
    """)
    con.commit()

    cur.execute("SELECT version FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version")
    applied = {row[0] for row in cur.fetchall()}

    migration_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    files = sorted(f for f in os.listdir(migration_dir) if re.match(r'^\d{3}_.*\.sql$', f))

    for f in files:
        version = int(f[:3])
        if version in applied:
            continue
        print(f"Applying migration {f}...")
        sql = open(os.path.join(migration_dir, f)).read()
        try:
            cur.execute(sql)
            cur.execute(
                "INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, filename) VALUES (%s, %s)",
                (version, f),
            )
            con.commit()
        except Exception:
            con.rollback()
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    migrate()
```

The Docker entrypoint runs `python migrations/migrate.py` before `uvicorn`. This is idempotent — re-running skips already-applied migrations.

**Migration file inventory:** The `migrations/` directory must contain these files at launch. Each migration is a single SQL file wrapped in a transaction. Migrations are irreversible by design — to undo, write a new forward migration.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `001_init.sql` | Core tables: `customers`, `api_keys`, `api_key_audit_log`, `employer_profile`, `inspection_history`, `pipeline_runs`, `pipeline_errors`, `cluster_id_mapping`, `stripe_webhook_events`, `test_fixtures`, `schema_migrations` (if not auto-created) |
| `002_subscriptions.sql` | `webhook_subscriptions` table + GIN index on `employer_ids` |
| `003_batch_jobs.sql` | `batch_jobs` table for async batch processing |
| `004_api_usage.sql` | `api_usage` table for metered quota tracking |
| `005_risk_snapshots.sql` | `risk_snapshots` table for historical trend queries |

**Rollback strategy:** There is no automated rollback. If a migration fails mid-execution, Postgres transactional DDL ensures the entire migration is rolled back atomically (all DDL in Postgres is transactional). The `schema_migrations` row is only inserted on success, so a failed migration will be retried on the next deploy. To undo a successfully applied migration, write a new migration (e.g., `006_revert_risk_snapshots.sql`) that reverses the schema change.

**Local development:** Run `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... python migrations/migrate.py` manually. No separate dev/prod migration tracks — same files, same runner, same order.

#### 3.4.1 Pipeline Monitoring

```sql
CREATE TABLE pipeline_runs (
    run_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,             -- e.g., 'osha_inspections', 'whd', 'msha'
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running',  -- running / success / failed
    rows_fetched INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    rows_loaded INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_message TEXT,
    started_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    finished_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3.4.2 employer_profile

The core table. One row per employer per snapshot date. The primary key is `(employer_id, snapshot_date)` to support historical tracking — every nightly run produces a new snapshot. <!-- v6: [finding #6] snapshot pattern -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE employer_profile (
    -- v6: [finding #2] Replaced cluster_id TEXT with stable employer_id UUID
    employer_id             UUID NOT NULL,
    snapshot_date           DATE NOT NULL,              -- v6: [finding #6] historical tracking
    pipeline_run_id         UUID NOT NULL,              -- v6: [finding #6] ties row to pipeline run

    -- Identity

    osha_violations_5yr     INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    osha_serious_willful    INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    osha_total_penalties    NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
    osha_open_date_latest   DATE,
    osha_avg_gravity        NUMERIC(4,2),

    -- WHD
    whd_cases_5yr           INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    whd_backwages_total     NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
    whd_ee_violated_total   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    -- MSHA

    nlrb_case_types         TEXT[],

    oflc_lca_count          INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    oflc_pw_wage_levels     TEXT[],

    -- Composite risk
    risk_tier               TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (risk_tier IN ('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'ELEVATED', 'HIGH')),  -- v6.1: aligned with dbt CASE output (was 'MODERATE'/'CRITICAL')
    risk_score              NUMERIC(5,2),
    risk_flags              TEXT[],

    -- Timestamps
    created_at              TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),    -- v6: added
    updated_at              TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),    -- v6: added

    PRIMARY KEY (employer_id, snapshot_date)             -- v6: [finding #6] composite PK
);

-- Indexes for API query patterns
-- v6.1: pg_trgm GIN index required for fuzzy name search on GET /v1/employers?name=
-- Must run: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm; before creating this index
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_employer_name_trgm ON employer_profile USING gin (employer_name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_employer_name ON employer_profile (employer_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_ein ON employer_profile (ein);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_naics ON employer_profile (naics_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_risk_tier ON employer_profile (risk_tier);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_snapshot ON employer_profile (snapshot_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_ep_employer_snapshot ON employer_profile (employer_id, snapshot_date DESC);
```

**Latest-snapshot view** — the API queries this by default:

```sql
-- v6: [finding #6] Convenience view for "current" employer profile
CREATE VIEW employer_profile_latest AS
SELECT DISTINCT ON (employer_id) *
FROM employer_profile
ORDER BY employer_id, snapshot_date DESC;
```

**Risk tier boundary note (finding #34):** The rule engine must not leave a gap between MODERATE and HIGH. Specifically: an employer with 1 inspection and >= 10 violations in that single inspection MUST be caught. The rule `osha_serious_willful >= 3 OR (osha_inspections_5yr >= 1 AND osha_violations_5yr >= 10)` closes this gap. Encode this in `dbt/models/risk_tier.sql`, not in application code.

#### 3.4.3 cluster_id_mapping

Splink produces transient `cluster_id` values that change between runs. This table maps them to stable `employer_id` UUIDs that persist across pipeline runs.

```sql
-- v6: new table — maps Splink's transient cluster_id to stable employer_id
-- v6.2: added superseded_by for split/merge audit trail
CREATE TABLE cluster_id_mapping (
    employer_id     UUID NOT NULL,
    cluster_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
    pipeline_run_id UUID NOT NULL,
    first_seen_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    superseded_by   UUID,           -- v6.2: if this employer was absorbed by a merge/split, points to the surviving employer_id. NULL = active.
    PRIMARY KEY (employer_id, cluster_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_cluster_mapping_active ON cluster_id_mapping (employer_id) WHERE superseded_by IS NULL;
```

**How it works:** After each Splink run, the pipeline checks each `cluster_id` against prior mappings. If existing records in the cluster match a known `employer_id`, the same UUID is reused. If the cluster is entirely new, a new UUID is generated. This is the mechanism that makes `employer_id` stable across runs — Splink's `cluster_id` is an implementation detail that never leaks to the API.

<!-- v6.2: Explicit split/merge/orphan rules (see update_cluster_mapping in §4.8) -->

**Split/merge stability rules:**
- **Split:** Previous cluster fractures into N new clusters. The largest new cluster (by member record count) inherits the original `employer_id`. Smaller fragments get new UUIDs. This ensures the "primary" identity persists.
- **Merge:** N previous clusters collapse into 1. The new cluster inherits the `employer_id` of the previous cluster with the most shared member records. Losing `employer_id`s are marked with `superseded_by` pointing to the winner.
- **Orphan handling:** API lookups on a `superseded_by IS NOT NULL` employer_id return HTTP 301 with `Location: /v1/employers/{superseded_by}`. This lets API consumers follow the redirect to the surviving entity without breaking bookmarks.
- **Audit:** `superseded_by` records are never deleted. They form a permanent chain of identity evolution.

#### 3.4.4 inspection_history

Denormalized inspection records per employer, per snapshot. Supports the `/employers/{id}/inspections` endpoint and historical trend queries.

```sql
-- v6: new table — was referenced in v5 but never formally defined
CREATE TABLE inspection_history (
    id               BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employer_id      UUID NOT NULL,
    activity_nr      TEXT NOT NULL,
    agency           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'OSHA',
    inspection_date  DATE,
    insp_type_label  TEXT,
    violations       JSONB,              -- [{citation_id, viol_type, gravity, penalty}, ...]
    snapshot_date    DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_insp_employer ON inspection_history (employer_id);
```

#### 3.4.5 Auth & Billing — customers

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name    TEXT NOT NULL,
    email           TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash   TEXT NOT NULL,        -- v6: [finding #16] argon2id (time_cost=3, memory_cost=65536, parallelism=4)
    role            TEXT DEFAULT 'viewer' CHECK (role IN ('viewer', 'analyst', 'admin')),  -- v6: [finding #24] RBAC
    stripe_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
    plan            TEXT DEFAULT 'free',  -- free / starter / pro / enterprise
    monthly_limit   INTEGER DEFAULT 5,   -- free tier = 5 lookups/month
    current_usage   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()   -- v6: added
);
```

**Password hashing config (finding #16):** Use argon2id with these parameters:
- `time_cost=3` (iterations)
- `memory_cost=65536` (64 MB)
- `parallelism=4`
- Salt: 16 bytes from `os.urandom()`

Do **not** use bcrypt. argon2id is the current OWASP recommendation and resists both GPU and side-channel attacks.

**Roles (finding #24):**
- `viewer` — can call `GET /employers/{id}`, read-only.
- `analyst` — viewer + batch endpoints + bulk export.
- `admin` — all endpoints including key management, customer management, subscription management.

#### 3.4.6 Auth & Billing — api_keys

```sql
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    key_id          UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() UNIQUE,  -- v6: [finding #23] lookup by key_id, not key_prefix
    customer_id     INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    key_hash        TEXT NOT NULL,         -- SHA-256 of the raw API key
    key_prefix      TEXT NOT NULL,         -- first 8 chars, for display only (not for lookup)
    label           TEXT,                  -- human-readable name: "production", "staging"
    scopes          TEXT[] DEFAULT '{employer:read}',  -- v6: [finding #24] role-based scopes
    monthly_limit   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,        -- v6: [finding #32] 0 = disabled. NULL no longer bypasses quota.
    current_usage   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    expires_at      TIMESTAMP,            -- v6: [finding #31] key expiration
    status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'rotating_out', 'revoked')),  -- v6.1: replaced is_active BOOLEAN to match code (active/rotating_out/revoked)
    rotation_expires_at TIMESTAMP,        -- v6.1: when rotating_out keys should be revoked (48h NIST window)
    last_used_at    TIMESTAMP,            -- v6.1: referenced in auth middleware _update_last_used()
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Scopes (finding #24):**
- `employer:read` — query single employer profiles
- `batch:write` — submit batch lookup jobs
- `subscriptions:manage` — create/update/delete webhook subscriptions
- `admin:all` — unrestricted access

**Quota enforcement (finding #32):** A `monthly_limit` of `0` means the key is disabled (zero calls allowed). There is no magic NULL bypass. Every key must have an explicit numeric limit.

> **v6.2 clarification — canonical quota mechanism:** Quota is enforced by counting rows in `api_usage` where `queried_at >= date_trunc('month', NOW())` (see `check_monthly_quota` in §5.2). This is the **only** quota enforcement mechanism. The `current_usage` column on `api_keys` is a **denormalized cache for display purposes only** (used in dashboard headers like `X-Lookups-Remaining`). It is NOT checked during request authorization. The `reset_monthly_usage.py` cron job zeroes this display counter on the 1st of each month. If the cron job fails, quota enforcement is unaffected — only the dashboard display will be stale until the next reset.

**Key expiration (finding #31):** The auth middleware checks `expires_at` on every request. Expired keys return `401` with `{"error": "api_key_expired", "message": "This API key expired on {date}. Generate a new key."}`. There is no grace period.

#### 3.4.7 api_key_audit_log

Every key lifecycle event is recorded. No deletions from this table — it is append-only.

```sql
-- v6: [finding #29] new table — audit trail for API key lifecycle
CREATE TABLE api_key_audit_log (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    key_id          UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES api_keys(key_id),  -- v6.1: was missing FK; orphan rows possible
    customer_id     INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    action          TEXT NOT NULL,         -- created / rotated / revoked / quota_changed / scope_changed
    performed_by    TEXT,                  -- email or system identifier
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 3.4.8 stripe_webhook_events

Idempotency table for Stripe webhooks. The `event_id` column is Stripe's `event.id` — inserting a duplicate fails on the PK constraint, which is how we detect and skip replayed events.

```sql
-- v6: [finding #17] new table — Stripe webhook idempotency
CREATE TABLE stripe_webhook_events (
    event_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,      -- Stripe event.id; UNIQUE = idempotency guard
    event_type      TEXT NOT NULL,         -- e.g., 'customer.subscription.updated'
    processed_at    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Usage pattern:**
```python
try:
    cur.execute(
        "INSERT INTO stripe_webhook_events (event_id, event_type) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (event["id"], event["type"]),
    )
except psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation:
    # Already processed — skip
    return JSONResponse({"status": "duplicate"}, status_code=200)
```

#### 3.4.9 subscriptions

Webhook subscriptions for continuous monitoring. Customers register a callback URL and a list of employer IDs. When the nightly pipeline detects a risk-tier change or new violation for a subscribed employer, it fires an HMAC-signed POST to the callback URL.

```sql
-- v6: [finding #38] new table — webhook subscriptions for monitoring mode
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
    id              UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id     INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    employer_ids    UUID[] NOT NULL,       -- array of employer_ids to watch
    callback_url    TEXT NOT NULL,         -- must be HTTPS
    signing_secret  TEXT NOT NULL,         -- HMAC-SHA256 key for payload verification
    events          TEXT[] DEFAULT '{risk_tier_change}',  -- risk_tier_change / new_violation / new_inspection
    status          TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'paused', 'disabled')),
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- v6.1: Missing indexes — customer_id for list queries, GIN on employer_ids for
-- webhook dispatch (pipeline needs to find all subscriptions watching a given employer_id).
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_customer ON subscriptions (customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_employer_ids ON subscriptions USING GIN (employer_ids);
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_status ON subscriptions (status) WHERE status = 'active';
```

**Webhook payload signing:** Every outbound webhook POST includes a `X-StableLabel-Signature` header containing `HMAC-SHA256(signing_secret, raw_body)`. The subscriber verifies the signature before trusting the payload. This is the same pattern Stripe uses.

**Callback requirements:**
- `callback_url` must be HTTPS. The API rejects HTTP URLs at subscription creation time.
- The pipeline retries failed deliveries 3 times with exponential backoff (10s, 60s, 300s).
- After 3 consecutive failures, the subscription `status` flips to `disabled` and the customer is notified via email.

#### 3.4.10 api_usage

<!-- v6.1: was referenced in auth middleware but never defined -->

Metering table. One row per API call. Used for quota enforcement and billing analytics.

    customer_id     INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    endpoint        TEXT,                  -- e.g., '/v1/employers'
    queried_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()

<!-- v6.2: Test fixtures seeding strategy and free-tier vs sandbox distinction -->

**Seeding strategy:** Test fixtures are loaded from `seeds/test_fixtures.sql` — a file of 50 INSERT statements with hand-curated data covering all risk tiers, confidence tiers, and edge cases. This file is committed to the repo and applied via migration `001_init.sql`. Fixtures are NEVER generated from production data.

The 50 fixtures must cover:
- At least 5 employers per risk tier (LOW/MEDIUM/ELEVATED/HIGH)
- At least 2 with EIN, at least 2 without (confidence tier coverage)
- At least 2 with multi-source violations (OSHA + WHD + MSHA)
- At least 1 with `sam_debarred = true`
- At least 1 with trend_signal = WORSENING, 1 = IMPROVING
- At least 1 per NAICS sector (construction, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, transportation)
- Deterministic UUIDs (e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` through `...050`) for reproducible tests

**Free tier vs sandbox — these are different things:**
- **Free tier**: A real production API key with `monthly_limit=5`. Queries real `employer_profile` data. Exists for developer evaluation. Requires signup but no credit card.
- **Sandbox (test keys)**: Keys prefixed `emp_test_` that route to the `test_fixtures` table. Returns frozen, deterministic data. Does NOT consume quota. Exists for integration testing — developers build against it before going live.
- **Code-level distinction**: `verify_key()` checks `key.startswith('emp_test_')`. If true, all queries read from `test_fixtures` instead of `employer_profile`. The `check_monthly_quota` function is skipped entirely for test keys.

#### 3.4.16 pipeline_errors

<!-- v6.1: was referenced in dead-letter pattern (4.2) but never defined -->

Append-only table for partial ingestion failures. Lives in `pipeline` schema alongside `pipeline_runs`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pipeline_errors (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    run_id          UUID NOT NULL,
    source          TEXT NOT NULL,          -- e.g., 'ingest_dol', 'ingest_fmcsa'
    error_message   TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 3.4.17 risk_snapshots

<!-- v6.1: was referenced in risk-history endpoint (8.4) but never defined -->

Lightweight snapshot for the `/employers/{id}/risk-history` endpoint. Populated nightly during the pipeline sync step.

```sql
CREATE TABLE risk_snapshots (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employer_id     UUID NOT NULL,
    snapshot_date   DATE NOT NULL,
    risk_tier       TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (risk_tier IN ('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'ELEVATED', 'HIGH')),
    confidence_tier TEXT,
    osha_inspection_count_5yr INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    osha_violation_count_5yr  INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    osha_penalty_total_5yr    NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
    violation_rate_trend      TEXT,
    pipeline_run_id UUID,
    UNIQUE (employer_id, snapshot_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_risk_snap_employer ON risk_snapshots (employer_id, snapshot_date DESC);
```

#### 3.4.18 batch_jobs

<!-- v6.1: Async batch endpoints (POST /v1/employers/batch, GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}) referenced
     job tracking but no Postgres table or R2 storage scheme was defined. -->

Tracks async batch job state. Jobs with >25 items run asynchronously; results are stored in R2.

```sql
CREATE TABLE batch_jobs (
    job_id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,       -- format: "job_" + gen_random_uuid()
    customer_id     INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'processing'
                    CHECK (status IN ('processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
    items_total     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    items_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    items_found     INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    result_url      TEXT,                   -- R2 presigned URL, set on completion
    expires_at      TIMESTAMP,             -- results expire after 24h
    error_message   TEXT,
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at    TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_batch_jobs_customer ON batch_jobs (customer_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_batch_jobs_status ON batch_jobs (status) WHERE status = 'processing';
```

**R2 storage scheme:**
- Bucket: `compliance-batch-results`
- Key pattern: `jobs/{job_id}.json`
- Lifecycle: R2 lifecycle rule auto-deletes objects after 24 hours
- The `result_url` stored in `batch_jobs` is a presigned R2 URL valid for 24h
- Example: `https://r2.yourdomain.com/compliance-batch-results/jobs/job_abc123.json`

**Job ID format:** `"job_" + UUID v4` (e.g., `job_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`). The `job_` prefix makes IDs self-documenting in logs and URLs.

## Part 2A: Pipeline Architecture (Section 4)

## 4 Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline ingests raw federal data, normalizes it through medallion layers, resolves entities, and syncs the result to Postgres for API consumption. Everything runs inside a Docker container on the dedicated pipeline server (64 GB RAM, 16 cores).

### 4.1 Medallion Layers

| Layer | Storage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Bronze** | Raw Parquet files in `/data/bronze/` | Byte-for-byte copies of federal source files, partitioned by source and ingestion date. No transformations. |
| **Silver** | DuckDB tables via dbt | Normalized column names, parsed addresses, seed-joined labels. One model per source. |
| **Gold** | DuckDB tables via dbt + Splink | Entity-resolved clusters, canonical names, cross-source bridges (EIN, FMCSA, SAM). |
| **Gold+** | Postgres materialized table `employer_profile` | The single wide table the API reads. Also includes `inspection_history` for drill-down. Populated by shadow-table swap during sync. |

Data flows strictly downward: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Gold+. No upstream writes.

### 4.2 run_pipeline.sh

The orchestrator script. Runs nightly via cron inside the pipeline Docker container. v6 makes three structural changes: SQLite is gone (finding #9), partial-failure tolerance replaces `set -e` (finding #8), and post-sync validation catches row-count drift (finding #5).

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# run_pipeline.sh — runs inside pipeline Docker container
# v6: flock prevents overlap with backup (finding #55)
exec 200>/var/lock/pipeline.lock
flock -n 200 || { echo "Pipeline already running"; exit 1; }

cd /opt/employer-compliance
RUN_ID=$(python -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())')

# Write start to Postgres (v6: finding #9 — no more SQLite)
python pipeline/db.py start $RUN_ID

# Step 1: Ingest — partial failure tolerant (v6: finding #8)
ERRORS=0
python pipeline/ingest_dol.py       2>&1 || { python pipeline/db.py log_error $RUN_ID 'ingest_dol failed'; ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1)); }
python pipeline/ingest_fmcsa.py     2>&1 || { python pipeline/db.py log_error $RUN_ID 'ingest_fmcsa failed'; ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1)); }
python pipeline/ingest_oflc.py      2>&1 || { python pipeline/db.py log_error $RUN_ID 'ingest_oflc failed'; ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1)); }
python pipeline/ingest_sam.py       2>&1 || { python pipeline/db.py log_error $RUN_ID 'ingest_sam failed'; ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1)); }

# Step 2: Validate bronze — HALT on failure (GX is the quality gate)
python pipeline/validate_bronze.py || { python pipeline/db.py fail $RUN_ID 'GX validation failed'; exit 1; }

# Step 3: Address parsing — MUST precede dbt
python pipeline/parse_addresses.py

# Step 4: dbt transformations — v6.1: dbt test now gates the pipeline (was silent on failure)
dbt seed  --project-dir dbt/ --profiles-dir dbt/
dbt run   --project-dir dbt/ --profiles-dir dbt/
dbt test  --project-dir dbt/ --profiles-dir dbt/ || { python pipeline/db.py fail $RUN_ID 'dbt test failed'; exit 1; }

# Step 5: Entity resolution
python pipeline/entity_resolution.py

# Step 6: Sync to Postgres (shadow-table swap)
# v6.1: Fixed naming — was sync_to_postgres.py but code block defined sync.py
python pipeline/sync.py

# Step 7: Post-sync validation (v6: finding #5)
python pipeline/validate_sync.py $RUN_ID || { python pipeline/db.py fail $RUN_ID 'Post-sync validation failed'; exit 1; }

# Step 8: Dispatch webhooks for risk tier changes
python pipeline/dispatch_webhooks.py $RUN_ID

python pipeline/db.py success $RUN_ID $ERRORS
echo "Pipeline run $RUN_ID complete (warnings: $ERRORS)"
```

**Design decisions:**

- **flock (finding #55):** The `flock -n` call is non-blocking. If the nightly backup cron holds the lock, the pipeline exits immediately rather than queuing. The backup script acquires the same `/var/lock/pipeline.lock` before starting `pg_dump`.
- **Dead-letter pattern (finding #8):** Ingestion steps log failures to the `pipeline_errors` table and increment the warning counter, but the pipeline continues. Only Great Expectations validation (Step 2) and post-sync validation (Step 7) are hard gates that abort the run. This means a temporary DOL outage does not block FMCSA and SAM data from refreshing.
- **No SQLite (finding #9):** Pipeline run metadata writes directly to Postgres via `pipeline/db.py`. The `pipeline_runs` and `pipeline_errors` tables live in the `pipeline` schema, separate from the `public` schema the API reads.
- **Post-sync validation (finding #5):** `validate_sync.py` queries DuckDB for expected row counts per source table, then queries Postgres for actual counts. A mismatch beyond 0.1% fails the run.
- **Webhook dispatch (v6.1 fix):** Step 8 diffs `employer_profile` against `employer_profile_prev` — the old table retained during the shadow-table swap. Previous version renamed to `employer_profile_old` and dropped it immediately, making the diff impossible. Now the swap renames the old table to `employer_profile_prev` and keeps it alive. `dispatch_webhooks.py` drops `employer_profile_prev` after completing the diff. Any `risk_tier` change fires a webhook to registered subscribers.

FMCSA_API_KEY = open('/run/secrets/fmcsa_api_key').read().strip()
BASE = 'https://mobile.fmcsa.dot.gov/qc/services/carriers'

### 4.4 OFLC Debarments

OFLC publishes a debarment list for employers found to have violated H-2A/H-2B visa program rules. The ingestion script pulls the latest list and loads it into Bronze.

```python
# pipeline/ingest_oflc.py
import requests, duckdb, pandas as pd

    xlsx_path.write_bytes(resp.content)

    df = pd.read_excel(xlsx_path)

    con.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ingest()
```

### 4.5 Address Parsing

Libpostal parses raw street addresses into structured components (street, city, state, zip). The parsed output is used to generate `address_key` for entity resolution. This step must complete before dbt runs, because Silver models join on parsed address output.

```python
# pipeline/parse_addresses.py
import duckdb
from postal.parser import parse_address

def parse_all():
    con = duckdb.connect('/data/duckdb/employer_compliance.duckdb')
    con.execute("SET memory_limit='40GB'")   # v6: finding #58 — pipeline server has 64GB RAM
    con.execute("SET threads=16")            # v6: finding #58 — match pipeline server CPU count

    # Gather all unique raw addresses from OSHA + WHD
    raw = con.execute("""

        ) WHERE street_raw IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(street_raw) != ''
    """).fetchdf()

    parsed_rows = []
    for _, row in raw.iterrows():
        addr = row['street_raw']
        components = {c[1]: c[0] for c in parse_address(addr)}
        parsed_rows.append({
            'raw_address': addr,
            'house_number': components.get('house_number', ''),
            'road': components.get('road', ''),
            'city': components.get('city', ''),
            'state': components.get('state', ''),
            'postcode': components.get('postcode', ''),
            'address_key': f"{components.get('house_number', '')} {components.get('road', '')}".strip().upper(),
        })

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(parsed_rows)
    con.register('parsed_df', df)
    con.execute("CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE osha_parsed_addresses AS SELECT * FROM parsed_df WHERE raw_address IN (SELECT site_address FROM raw_osha_inspection)")
    con.execute("CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE whd_parsed_addresses AS SELECT * FROM parsed_df WHERE raw_address IN (SELECT street_addr_1 FROM raw_whd_whisard)")
    con.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parse_all()
```

### 4.6 Name Normalization Macro

A dbt macro applied in every Silver model that produces a `name_normalized` column. Strips punctuation, expands abbreviations, removes corporate suffixes and location identifiers.

```sql
{% macro normalize_name(field) %}
REGEXP_REPLACE(
  REGEXP_REPLACE(
    REGEXP_REPLACE(
      REGEXP_REPLACE(
        REGEXP_REPLACE(UPPER(TRIM({{ field }})), '[^A-Z0-9 ]', ''),
        '\\bMFG\\b', 'MANUFACTURING'),
      '\\bSVC\\b', 'SERVICE'),
    '\\b(STORE|UNIT|LOCATION|PLANT|SITE|BRANCH)\\s*#?\\s*[0-9]+\\b', ''),
  '\\b(LLC|INC|CORP|LTD|LP|LLP|STORES|COMPANY|HOLDINGS|CO|THE)\\b', ''),
'\\s+', ' ')
{% endmacro %}
```

The order of operations matters: uppercase first, then strip non-alphanumeric, then expand abbreviations, then remove location suffixes, then remove corporate suffixes, then collapse whitespace. Reversing any of these steps produces incorrect matches.

The `employer_profile` model is the single materialized table the API reads. It joins Gold-layer entity clusters with aggregated violation metrics and computes three derived columns: `risk_tier`, `trend_signal`, and `confidence_tier`.

**dbt model config:**

```sql
-- models/gold_plus/employer_profile.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    unique_key='employer_id',
    post_hook="ANALYZE employer_profile"
) }}
```

**Risk Tier:**

v6 fixes the boundary gap at `osha_violation_count_5yr = 10` (finding #34) and wraps every numeric field in `COALESCE` for NULL safety (finding #7). Previous versions left a gap where exactly 10 violations fell through to LOW.

```sql
CASE
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_willful_count_5yr, 0) >= 1                    THEN 'HIGH'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_repeat_count_5yr, 0)  >= 3                    THEN 'HIGH'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_penalty_total_5yr, 0) > 100000                THEN 'HIGH'
  WHEN sam_debarred = true                                          THEN 'HIGH'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_inspection_count_5yr, 0) >= 5
       AND COALESCE(osha_violation_count_5yr, 0) >= 10             THEN 'ELEVATED'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_inspection_count_5yr, 0) >= 3
       AND (COALESCE(whd_violation_count_5yr, 0) > 0
            OR COALESCE(msha_violation_count_5yr, 0) > 0
            OR COALESCE(ofccp_violation_count_5yr, 0) > 0)         THEN 'ELEVATED'
  WHEN industry_citation_rate IS NOT NULL
       AND industry_median_rate IS NOT NULL
       AND industry_citation_rate > industry_median_rate * 2.5      THEN 'ELEVATED'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_violation_count_5yr, 0) >= 10                 THEN 'MEDIUM'  -- v6: finding #34 boundary fix
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_inspection_count_5yr, 0) BETWEEN 2 AND 4     THEN 'MEDIUM'
  WHEN COALESCE(osha_violation_count_5yr, 0) BETWEEN 3 AND 9      THEN 'MEDIUM'
  ELSE 'LOW'
END AS risk_tier
```

Walk through the logic: HIGH captures the most severe signals (willful violations, repeat offenders, large penalties, federal debarment). ELEVATED captures patterns suggesting systemic issues (high inspection+violation combos, cross-agency violations, outlier citation rates). MEDIUM covers moderate activity. Everything else is LOW. The `>= 10` on the MEDIUM line (finding #34) closes the gap where v5 had `> 10` in ELEVATED but `BETWEEN 3 AND 9` in MEDIUM, leaving exactly-10 to fall through to LOW.

**Risk Score (numeric):**

<!-- v6.2: risk_score was in the schema but never defined. This is the canonical formula. -->

`risk_score` is a continuous 0–100 numeric that provides granularity within tiers. It is stored alongside `risk_tier` but **the tier is authoritative** — `risk_score` is for sorting within a tier, not for overriding tier boundaries. The formula is a weighted sum, clamped to [0, 100]:

```sql
LEAST(100, GREATEST(0,
    COALESCE(osha_willful_count_5yr, 0) * 25
  + COALESCE(osha_repeat_count_5yr, 0)  * 10
  + COALESCE(osha_serious_count_5yr, 0) * 5
  + COALESCE(osha_other_count_5yr, 0)   * 1
  + CASE WHEN sam_debarred THEN 30 ELSE 0 END
  + LEAST(20, COALESCE(osha_penalty_total_5yr, 0) / 10000.0)
  + CASE WHEN COALESCE(whd_violation_count_5yr, 0) > 0 THEN 5 ELSE 0 END
  + CASE WHEN COALESCE(msha_violation_count_5yr, 0) > 0 THEN 5 ELSE 0 END
)) AS risk_score
```

The weights are intentionally simple and reviewable. They will be tuned with customer feedback in Phase 2. `risk_score` is exposed in the API response but never referenced in tier assignment logic — if `risk_score` and `risk_tier` appear to disagree, the tier is correct (the score is supplementary context).

**Trend Signal:**

```sql
CASE
  WHEN osha_violation_count_1yr > osha_violation_count_3yr / 3.0 * 1.5
       AND osha_violation_count_3yr >= 3                            THEN 'WORSENING'
  WHEN osha_violation_count_1yr < osha_violation_count_3yr / 3.0 * 0.5
       AND osha_violation_count_3yr >= 3                            THEN 'IMPROVING'
  ELSE 'STABLE'
END AS trend_signal
```

The trend compares the most recent year's violation rate against the annualized three-year average. A 1.5x spike flags WORSENING; a 0.5x drop flags IMPROVING. The `>= 3` guard prevents noise from low-count employers.

**Confidence Tier:**

v6 fixes the EIN-only match logic (finding #39). In v5, an EIN match without an address match was scored MEDIUM. An EIN is a unique federal identifier — if it matches, confidence is HIGH regardless of address or name similarity.

```sql
CASE
  WHEN ein IS NOT NULL THEN 'HIGH'   -- v6: finding #39 — EIN is a unique federal ID, always HIGH
  WHEN address_key IS NOT NULL
   AND jaro_winkler_similarity(canonical_name, whd_legal_name) > 0.90 THEN 'MEDIUM'
  ELSE 'LOW'
END AS confidence_tier
```

### 4.8 Entity Resolution (Splink)

Splink performs probabilistic record linkage to cluster records that refer to the same physical employer. v6 adds a third blocking rule for multi-geography employers (finding #11), stable employer_id UUID mapping, and model drift monitoring (finding #13).

    v6.2: Explicit rules for splits, merges, and orphans:

    STABILITY RULES:
    1. EXACT MATCH:  If new cluster_id == existing cluster_id in mapping → reuse employer_id.
    2. OVERLAP:      If new cluster shares ≥1 member record (activity_nr) with a previous cluster
                     → inherit that cluster's employer_id. This handles Splink reassigning IDs.
    3. SPLIT:        If a previous cluster splits into N new clusters, each new cluster checks
                     overlap independently. The LARGEST new cluster (by member count) inherits
                     the original employer_id. Smaller fragments get new UUIDs. This is enforced
                     by the `LIMIT 1` + ordering by overlap count below.
    4. MERGE:        If N previous clusters merge into 1 new cluster, the new cluster inherits
                     the employer_id of the previous cluster with the MOST member records.
                     The other previous employer_ids become orphans (kept in cluster_id_mapping
                     with a `superseded_by` column for audit trail, but never returned by API).
    5. NEW CLUSTER:  No overlap with any previous cluster → new UUID.
    6. ORPHAN CLEANUP: Previous employer_ids that no longer map to any active cluster are
                     marked `superseded_by = <winning_employer_id>` but NOT deleted. API

**Key design decisions:**

- **Three blocking rules (finding #11):** The first two rules (zip5; state+name prefix) fail to pair records for employers operating across multiple states under the same name. The third rule (`name_prefix + naics_4digit`) catches national chains like "WALMART" that appear in every state. Without it, Walmart Store #1234 in Texas and Walmart Store #5678 in Ohio never enter the comparison space.
- **Stable employer_id mapping:** Splink assigns new `cluster_id` values on every run. The `cluster_id_mapping` table maintains a stable UUID (`employer_id`) that persists across runs. If a cluster's member records overlap with a previous cluster, the old UUID is inherited. This is critical for API consumers who bookmark employer URLs.
- **Drift monitoring (finding #13):** After each run, the pipeline evaluates Splink predictions against human-reviewed pairs from `review_queue`. If fewer than 50 labeled pairs exist, monitoring is skipped with a warning. Once sufficient labels accumulate, precision/recall metrics are logged to `pipeline_runs` metadata for trend analysis.
- **Thresholds:** `threshold_match_probability=0.80` for predictions and `0.85` for clustering. The prediction threshold is intentionally looser to allow borderline pairs into the review queue. The clustering threshold is tighter to keep the Gold layer clean.
- **Pairs between 0.80-0.85:** These are predicted matches that don't cluster. They are explicitly routed into `review_queue` for human labeling. The pipeline inserts them after clustering:
  ```python
  borderline = pred_df[(pred_df['match_probability'] >= 0.80) & (pred_df['match_probability'] < 0.85)]
  for _, row in borderline.iterrows():
      con.execute("INSERT INTO review_queue (record_id_left, record_id_right, match_probability, pipeline_run_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
          [row['id_l'], row['id_r'], row['match_probability'], pipeline_run_id])
  ```
- **Comparison weights rationale:** `address_key` is ExactMatch (binary — either the normalized address matches or it doesn't). `name_normalized` uses JaroWinkler with two thresholds (0.92 = strong match, 0.80 = partial match) because company names have high variance in abbreviations. `naics_4digit` and `site_state` are ExactMatch because they are categorical codes.
- **Training strategy:** On first run, Splink uses unsupervised EM estimation (`estimate_u_using_random_sampling` + `estimate_parameters_using_expectation_maximisation`). No labeled training data is needed. As `review_queue` accumulates 200+ labeled pairs, switch to `linker.estimate_parameters_using_pairwise_labels()` for supervised fine-tuning. This is a Phase 2 task — Phase 1 runs fully unsupervised.

**Seeds** contain static reference data that rarely changes: NAICS codes, OSHA inspection type labels, violation type labels with severity ranks, and FMCSA BASIC category labels. These are checked into the dbt repo and loaded via `dbt seed`.

**Bronze models** are simple `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet(...)` wrappers that register raw Parquet files as DuckDB tables.

**Silver models** normalize column names, join seed labels, parse addresses, and compute `name_normalized`. Each source gets its own model.

**Gold models** perform cross-source joins: entity clustering, FMCSA matching, EIN bridging, SAM entity matching, and canonical name election.

**Gold+ models** produce the final API-facing tables. `employer_profile.sql` is the wide materialized table. `inspection_history.sql` (v6: formally defined) provides a per-employer timeline of inspections with violation details for the `/employers/{id}/inspections` endpoint.

### 4.10 Silver Model Definitions

**osha_violation_labeled.sql:**

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
SELECT
  v.activity_nr, v.citation_id, v.viol_type,
  vt.label AS viol_type_label, vt.severity_rank,
  v.standard, v.issuance_date,
  COALESCE(v.final_order_penalty, 0) AS final_order_penalty,
  COALESCE(v.init_penalty, 0) AS init_penalty
FROM {{ ref('raw_osha_violation') }} v
LEFT JOIN {{ ref('viol_type') }} vt ON v.viol_type = vt.code
```

The `severity_rank` from the seed table enables ordering violations by severity in the API response without hardcoding ranks in application code. `COALESCE` on penalty columns ensures NULLs (common in open cases) do not break downstream aggregations.

**whd_norm.sql:**

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
SELECT
  trade_nm, legal_name,
  {{ normalize_name('COALESCE(legal_name, trade_nm)') }} AS name_normalized,
  ein, bw_atp_amt AS back_wages, ee_atp_cnt AS employees_owed,
  naic_cd AS naics_code, street_addr_1 AS street_raw,
  city_nm, st_cd AS state, zip_cd AS zip_raw,
  LEFT(REGEXP_REPLACE(TRIM(zip_cd),'[^0-9]',''),5) AS zip5,
  pa.address_key
FROM {{ ref('raw_whd_whisard') }} w
LEFT JOIN whd_parsed_addresses pa ON w.street_addr_1 = pa.raw_address
WHERE ein IS NOT NULL OR back_wages > 0
```

The `WHERE` clause filters out records with neither an EIN nor back wages — these are typically administrative entries that add noise to entity resolution. The `COALESCE(legal_name, trade_nm)` prefers the legal name for normalization but falls back to the trade name when legal is NULL, which occurs in roughly 15% of WHD records.

## 5. Auth System

### 5.1 Key Generation

API keys use a `key_id` UUID for stable lookup instead of parsing a key prefix from the raw token. The raw key is shown exactly once in the browser response over HTTPS. It is never stored in plaintext and never emailed.

```python
# auth/keys.py
import secrets, hashlib, hmac, uuid

def generate_api_key(environment='production') -> dict:
    prefix = 'emp_live_' if environment == 'production' else 'emp_test_'
    raw = prefix + secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    key_id = str(uuid.uuid4())        # v6: finding #23 — stable lookup ID replaces key_prefix
    key_hash = hashlib.sha256(raw.encode()).hexdigest()
    return {'raw': raw, 'key_hash': key_hash, 'key_id': key_id}
    # v6: finding #22 — raw key shown ONCE in browser response over HTTPS
    # Never stored, never emailed. If lost, must regenerate.

def verify_key_constant_time(incoming: str, stored_hash: str) -> bool:
    incoming_hash = hashlib.sha256(incoming.encode()).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(incoming_hash, stored_hash)
```

### 5.2 FastAPI Auth Middleware

Major v6 changes in this middleware:

- HTTP 401 not 403 for invalid keys (finding #30)
- Exception handlers on background tasks (finding #18)
- Atomic quota check to fix TOCTOU race (finding #20)
- `monthly_limit=0` means key is disabled, not unlimited (finding #32)
- Test key routing to `test_fixtures` table (finding #26)
- RBAC scope checking (finding #24)

```python
# api/auth.py

<!-- v6.1: Scope checking was defined as a decorator but not confirmed applied to all endpoints.
     The table below is the canonical scope-to-endpoint mapping. Every /v1/ endpoint MUST use
     Depends(check_scope(...)) — endpoints missing it are a security bug. -->

**Scope enforcement matrix — every API endpoint and its required scope:**

| Endpoint | Method | Required Scope | Metered? |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| `/v1/employers` | GET | `employer:read` | Yes |
| `/v1/employers/{id}` | GET | `employer:read` | Yes |
| `/v1/employers/{id}/risk-history` | GET | `employer:read` | Yes |
| `/v1/employers/{id}/inspections` | GET | `employer:read` | No (free) |
| `/v1/employers/{id}/feedback` | POST | `employer:read` | No |
| `/v1/employers/batch` | POST | `batch:write` | Yes (1 per item) |
| `/v1/jobs/{id}` | GET | `batch:write` | No |
| `/v1/industries/{naics4}` | GET | `employer:read` | No |
| `/v1/industries/naics-codes` | GET | `employer:read` | No |
| `/v1/subscriptions` | GET | `subscriptions:manage` | No |
| `/v1/subscriptions` | POST | `subscriptions:manage` | No |
| `/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | PATCH | `subscriptions:manage` | No |
| `/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | DELETE | `subscriptions:manage` | No |
| `/v1/health` | GET | *(none — public)* | No |
| `/dashboard/keys` | GET | *(JWT session)* | No |
| `/dashboard/keys` | POST | *(JWT session)* | No |
| `/dashboard/keys/{id}/rotate` | POST | *(JWT session)* | No |
| `/dashboard/keys/{id}` | DELETE | *(JWT session)* | No |

`admin:all` bypasses all scope checks. Dashboard endpoints use JWT cookie auth, not API keys — scope checking does not apply (CSRF protection applies instead).

<!-- v6.2: Scope enforcement was defined as a function but never shown wired to endpoints.
     This is the canonical wiring pattern. Every /v1/ endpoint MUST follow it. -->

**Endpoint wiring pattern:** Every `/v1/` endpoint uses `Depends(check_scope(...))` as a parameter dependency. This is NOT optional — an endpoint missing it is a security bug.

```python
# api/routes/employers.py — canonical scope enforcement wiring

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, Query
from api.auth import check_scope, verify_key, record_usage

router = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")

@router.get("/employers")
async def search_employers(
    key_row=Depends(check_scope("employer:read")),  # scope gate — rejects 403 if missing
    name: str | None = Query(None),
    ein: str | None = Query(None),
    address: str | None = Query(None),
):
    await record_usage(key_row, endpoint="/v1/employers")  # metered
    # ... search logic ...

@router.get("/employers/{employer_id}/inspections")
async def get_inspections(
    employer_id: str,
    key_row=Depends(check_scope("employer:read")),  # scope required even on free endpoints
):
    # NOT metered — no record_usage call
    # ... inspection logic ...

@router.post("/employers/batch")
async def batch_lookup(
    key_row=Depends(check_scope("batch:write")),  # different scope
    # ... body ...
):
    await record_usage(key_row, endpoint="/v1/employers/batch", count=len(body.lookups))
    # ... batch logic ...

@router.post("/subscriptions")
async def create_subscription(
    key_row=Depends(check_scope("subscriptions:manage")),
    # ... body ...
):
    # NOT metered
    # ... subscription logic ...
```

**`record_usage` helper** (inserts into `api_usage` table for metered endpoints):

```python
async def record_usage(key_row, endpoint: str, count: int = 1):
    """Log metered API usage. Called only on metered endpoints (see matrix above)."""
    async with get_pool().acquire() as con:
        await con.execute("""
            INSERT INTO api_usage (key_hash, endpoint, queried_at, lookup_count)
            VALUES ($1, $2, NOW(), $3)
        """, key_row['key_hash'], endpoint, count)
        # Update denormalized display counter (not used for enforcement)
        await con.execute("""
            UPDATE api_keys SET current_usage = current_usage + $1
            WHERE key_hash = $2
        """, count, key_row['key_hash'])
```

### 5.3 Self-Serve Signup Flow

**Step 1: Signup** -- use argon2id, not bcrypt.

```
POST /auth/signup
{"email": "buyer@example.com", "password": "...", "org_name": "..."}

# Handler:
# 1. Validate email format, check not already registered
# 2. Hash password: argon2id (time_cost=3, memory_cost=65536, parallelism=4)  — v6: replaces bcrypt
# 3. INSERT into customers (email_verified=false, password_hash=hash, role='viewer')
# 4. Generate 32-byte token, hash with SHA-256, INSERT into email_verifications
# 5. Send verification email via Resend with token link
# 6. Return 202 Accepted
```

**Step 2: Email Verification.**

```
GET /auth/verify?token={raw_token}

# Handler:
# 1. Hash incoming token with SHA-256
# 2. Look up in email_verifications WHERE token_hash=... AND expires_at > NOW() AND used=false
# 3. Mark verification token used=true
# 4. UPDATE customers SET email_verified=true
# 5. Generate first API key
# 6. v6: finding #22 — DO NOT email the key. Redirect to dashboard where key is shown once.
# 7. Send welcome email with dashboard link (NOT the key itself)
# 8. Return 200 with redirect to dashboard
```

**Step 3: Password Reset.**

```
POST /auth/forgot-password  {"email": "buyer@example.com"}
# Generate reset token, INSERT into password_reset_tokens (1h expiry)
# v6: finding #21 — rate limited: 3 req/min
# Send email via Resend. Return 202 regardless (don't leak whether email exists)

POST /auth/reset-password  {"token": "...", "new_password": "..."}
# Hash token, look up WHERE token_hash=... AND expires_at > NOW() AND used = false
# v6: finding #25 — explicit AND used = false check
# Hash new password with argon2id, UPDATE customers SET password_hash=...
# Mark token used=true
```

**Step 4: Key Management.**

```
GET  /dashboard/keys            # list all keys for this customer (show key_id, key_prefix, status, scopes, expires_at)
POST /dashboard/keys            # generate a new named key — v6: raw key shown ONCE in response body
POST /dashboard/keys/{id}/rotate
# 1. Generate new key, INSERT as status='active'
# 2. UPDATE old key SET status='rotating_out', rotation_expires_at=NOW()+48h
# 3. v6: finding #22 — new key shown once in response, not emailed
# 4. Log rotation to api_key_audit_log (finding #29)
DELETE /dashboard/keys/{id}     # immediate revocation, log to audit
```

**Session Management (JWT) -- RS256.**

<!-- v6.2: Full JWT claims structure, key generation, and session persistence strategy -->

```
POST /auth/login {"email": "...", "password": "..."}
# Verify argon2id hash
# v6: finding #19 — RS256 JWT (asymmetric, not HS256)
# v6: finding #21 — rate limited: 10 req/min on /auth/login
```

**RSA keypair generation (run once per server, store at paths below):**
```bash
openssl genrsa -out /etc/employer-compliance/jwt_private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in /etc/employer-compliance/jwt_private.pem -pubout -out /etc/employer-compliance/jwt_public.pem
chmod 600 /etc/employer-compliance/jwt_private.pem
chmod 644 /etc/employer-compliance/jwt_public.pem
```

**JWT claims structure:**
```json
{
  "sub": "42",                          // customer_id (string, not int — JWT spec recommends string)
  "role": "analyst",                    // customer.role: viewer | analyst | admin
  "email": "user@example.com",         // for display; NOT used for authorization
  "iat": 1711900800,                   // issued-at (Unix timestamp)
  "exp": 1711929600,                   // expires: iat + 8 hours
  "iss": "employer-compliance-api",    // issuer — hardcoded string
  "jti": "a1b2c3d4-..."               // unique token ID (UUID v4) for revocation checks
}
```

**Session persistence strategy:**
- JWT is set as an **HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie** named `session`. NOT stored in localStorage (XSS risk) or JS memory (lost on refresh).
- HttpOnly prevents JavaScript access → immune to XSS token theft.
- SameSite=Lax prevents CSRF on most requests; POST/PUT/DELETE additionally require CSRF token (double-submit cookie pattern, §6.2).
- Token lifetime: **8 hours**. No refresh tokens. When the JWT expires, the user re-authenticates via `/auth/login`. This is acceptable for a B2B dashboard with infrequent use.
- **Why no refresh tokens:** Refresh tokens add complexity (rotation, storage, revocation) for minimal benefit in a dashboard that users visit a few times per week. 8-hour sessions cover a full workday. If users complain, add refresh tokens in Phase 2 with sliding expiry.

**Key rotation (finding #19):** The `rotate_keys.py` cron (hourly) does NOT rotate JWT keys — it rotates expiring API keys. JWT RSA keys are long-lived (rotate manually every 12 months). When rotating JWT keys: generate new keypair, deploy public key to API server first, then swap private key. Old tokens remain valid until their `exp` (max 8h window). No JWKS endpoint needed — single-server deployment.

**Decode — always pin algorithm:**
```python
import jwt
payload = jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=["RS256"], issuer="employer-compliance-api")
```

### 5.4 Test Keys

```
# v6: finding #26 — test keys isolated to test_fixtures table
if key.startswith('emp_test_'):
    return await get_fixture_employer(name, ein)
    # reads from test_fixtures table in Postgres
    # 50 real employers with known citation histories, frozen
    # No quota consumption
    # Cannot access production data
```

### 5.5 Key Rotation Cron

```python
# pipeline/rotate_keys.py — runs hourly
import asyncpg, asyncio

async def expire_rotating_keys():
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(PG_DSN)
    async with pool.acquire() as con:
        # v6: 48h NIST rotation window
        rotated = await con.execute("""
            UPDATE api_keys SET status='revoked'
            WHERE status='rotating_out'
            AND rotation_expires_at < NOW()
        """)
        # v6: finding #31 — also expire keys past their expires_at
        expired = await con.execute("""
            UPDATE api_keys SET status='revoked'
            WHERE status='active'
            AND expires_at IS NOT NULL
            AND expires_at < NOW()
        """)
        print(f'Revoked rotation keys: {rotated}, expired keys: {expired}')
    await pool.close()

asyncio.run(expire_rotating_keys())
```

### 5.6 Monthly Usage Reset

<!-- v6.1: reset_monthly_usage was referenced in quota enforcement (finding #32) but had
     no cron entry or implementation. Runs 1st of each month at midnight. -->

```python
# pipeline/reset_monthly_usage.py — runs 1st of each month via cron
import asyncpg, asyncio, os

async def reset():
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])
    async with pool.acquire() as con:
        result = await con.execute("""
            UPDATE api_keys SET current_usage = 0
            WHERE current_usage > 0
        """)
        print(f'Monthly usage reset: {result}')
    await pool.close()

asyncio.run(reset())
```

### 6.1 Environment Variables

<!-- v6.2: Split into two separate .env files — one per server.
     Previously a single .env was loaded by both servers, leaking pipeline secrets to the API
     server and vice versa. Docker Compose on each server now references its own file. -->

**API Server** — `/opt/employer-compliance/.env.api`:

```bash
# .env.api — API server only
PG_PASSWORD=<postgres password for api user>
MB_DB_PASS=<metabase postgres password>
PG_DSN=postgresql://api:${PG_PASSWORD}@localhost:6432/stablelabel
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/etc/employer-compliance/jwt_private.pem
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/etc/employer-compliance/jwt_public.pem
CSRF_SECRET=<64-char hex string>     # v6.2: persists across deploys. Generate: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../...
ENV=production
```

**Pipeline Server** — `/opt/employer-compliance/.env.pipeline`:

```bash
# .env.pipeline — Pipeline server only
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://pipeline_user:password@10.0.0.1:5432/stablelabel?sslmode=require
DUCKDB_PATH=/data/duckdb/employer_compliance.duckdb
DOL_API_KEY=<from dataportal.dol.gov>
SAM_API_KEY=<from sam.gov/content/entity-registration>
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../...
```

**Docker Compose reference:** Update `env_file:` in each compose file:
- `docker-compose.api.yml`: `env_file: .env.api`
- `docker-compose.pipeline.yml`: `env_file: .env.pipeline`

Add both `.env.api` and `.env.pipeline` to `.gitignore`. On servers: `chmod 600`. Commit `.env.api.example` and `.env.pipeline.example` (with placeholder values) to the repo.

### 6.2 Infrastructure -- Two-Server Architecture

This architecture was decided during conversation. Two Hetzner servers split pipeline compute from API serving.

**Pipeline Server** (Hetzner AX52, 64GB RAM, 8-core):

- DuckDB, dbt, Splink, cron jobs, backups
- DuckDB: `SET memory_limit='40GB'; SET threads=16;`
- Data paths: `/data/bronze/`, `/data/duckdb/`, `/data/tmp/`, `/data/backups/`

**API Server** (Hetzner CPX31, 8GB RAM):

- Postgres 16, pgBouncer, FastAPI, nginx, Metabase
- Hetzner floating IP for manual failover
- Ports: Postgres 5432 (127.0.0.1 only), pgBouncer 6432, FastAPI 8000, Metabase 3000, nginx 80/443

#### Cross-Server Networking

<!-- v6.1: was completely unspecified — production blocker -->

The pipeline server must reach the API server's Postgres for the nightly sync (shadow-table swap). Use a **Hetzner vSwitch** (private VLAN) between the two servers:

1. **Hetzner vSwitch** — Create a vSwitch in the Hetzner Cloud console. Attach both servers. This gives each server a private IP (e.g., `10.0.0.1` for API, `10.0.0.2` for pipeline) on an isolated L2 network. No public internet exposure.
2. **Postgres listens on private IP** — In `postgresql.conf`: `listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1'`. In `pg_hba.conf`: `host stablelabel pipeline_user 10.0.0.2/32 scram-sha-256`.
3. **Pipeline DATABASE_URL** — `postgresql://pipeline_user:password@10.0.0.1:5432/stablelabel?sslmode=require`
4. **TLS on the wire** — Set `sslmode=require` in the pipeline's DATABASE_URL. Generate a self-signed cert for Postgres or use Hetzner's private network (traffic never leaves their DC).
5. **Firewall rules** — On the API server: `ufw allow from 10.0.0.2 to any port 5432`. Deny all other inbound on 5432.

**Fallback option:** If vSwitch is unavailable, use a **WireGuard tunnel** between the two servers. WireGuard adds ~1ms latency and handles encryption natively. Pipeline connects to Postgres via the WireGuard IP.

#### Database Initialization Script

<!-- v6.2: Was completely missing — no specification for creating Postgres users, roles, or permissions. -->

Run this **once** on the API server's Postgres instance before first deploy. This creates the three database users with least-privilege permissions:

```sql
-- scripts/init_db.sql — run as postgres superuser on first setup
-- Usage: psql -U postgres -f scripts/init_db.sql

-- 1. Create database
CREATE DATABASE stablelabel;
\c stablelabel

-- 2. API user — owns all tables, used by FastAPI via pgBouncer
CREATE ROLE api WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'CHANGE_ME' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE stablelabel TO api;
-- After migrations run (api owns all tables), grant:
-- GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO api;
-- GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO api;

-- 3. Pipeline user — remote, writes to employer_profile + related tables only
CREATE ROLE pipeline_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'CHANGE_ME' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE stablelabel TO pipeline_user;
-- Grants applied after migrations:
-- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON employer_profile, employer_profile_staging,
--   employer_profile_prev, inspection_history, risk_snapshots, pipeline_runs,
--   pipeline_errors, cluster_id_mapping TO pipeline_user;
-- GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO pipeline_user;
-- DENY: pipeline_user cannot access customers, api_keys, api_usage, stripe_webhook_events

-- 4. Metabase user — read-only on all tables (for dashboards)
CREATE ROLE metabase_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'CHANGE_ME' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;

**Post-migration grants:** After `migrate.py` runs and creates all tables, apply the GRANT statements above. This can be a migration file itself (`006_grants.sql`) or run manually on first deploy. Subsequent migrations should include grants for any new tables they create.

  location /ui/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/; }
  location /webhooks/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; }
}
```

### CSRF Middleware

<!-- v6.1: was referenced but never implemented — finding #28 now has actual code -->

Dashboard endpoints use cookie-based JWT sessions (not API keys), so they need CSRF protection. The API key endpoints (`/v1/*`) are exempt because API keys are sent via `X-Api-Key` header, which is not auto-attached by browsers.

```python
# api/csrf.py — Double-submit cookie CSRF protection for dashboard
import secrets, hmac
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.responses import Response


CSRF_COOKIE = "csrf_token"
CSRF_HEADER = "X-CSRF-Token"
CSRF_SECRET = os.environ.get('CSRF_SECRET', '').encode() or secrets.token_bytes(32)
# v6.2: CSRF_SECRET is now loaded from environment variable (set in .env.api).
# This persists across process restarts and deploys, preventing dashboard sessions from
# being invalidated on every redeploy. Generate once: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# If env var is missing, falls back to random bytes (dev mode only — logs a warning).
SAFE_METHODS = {"GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"}
PROTECTED_PREFIXES = ("/dashboard/",)


class CSRFMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Only protect dashboard routes
        if not any(request.url.path.startswith(p) for p in PROTECTED_PREFIXES):
            return await call_next(request)

        # On GET: set CSRF cookie if missing
        if request.method in SAFE_METHODS:
            response = await call_next(request)
            if CSRF_COOKIE not in request.cookies:
                token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
                response.set_cookie(
                    CSRF_COOKIE, token,
                    httponly=False,  # JS must read this to send in header
                    secure=True,
                    samesite="strict",
                    max_age=3600 * 8,  # matches JWT expiry
                )
            return response

        # On POST/PUT/DELETE: validate double-submit
        cookie_token = request.cookies.get(CSRF_COOKIE)
        header_token = request.headers.get(CSRF_HEADER)
        if not cookie_token or not header_token:
            raise HTTPException(403, detail={"error": "csrf_missing", "message": "CSRF token required."})
        if not hmac.compare_digest(cookie_token, header_token):
            raise HTTPException(403, detail={"error": "csrf_invalid", "message": "CSRF token mismatch."})

        return await call_next(request)
```

**Usage in main.py:**
```python
from api.csrf import CSRFMiddleware
app.add_middleware(CSRFMiddleware)
```

### Cron Schedule

On the pipeline server:

```bash
# crontab -e (pipeline server)
# v6: finding #55 — flock prevents overlap

### Cron Alerting Wrapper

<!-- v6.1: finding #57 was claimed but never implemented.

### Snapshot Retention

<!-- v6.1: Retention policy was defined in Section 13.2 (risks) but had no implementation script or cron job. -->

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /opt/employer-compliance/prune_snapshots.sh
# Runs monthly (1st of month, via cron). Implements tiered retention:

## 8. API Design

This section defines every endpoint, request shape, response shape, header contract, and error convention for the Employer Compliance API. All identifiers use `employer_id` (UUID) as the primary key. Every change from v5 is marked inline.

---

### 8.1 Error Response Standard

Every non-2xx response returns a JSON body with four fields. No exceptions, no HTML, no bare strings.

```json
{
  "error": "monthly_quota_exceeded",
  "message": "You have used 5,000 of 5,000 lookups this month.",
  "resets_at": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  "documentation": "https://docs.yourdomain.com/errors#monthly_quota_exceeded"
}
```

Field rules:

- `error` — machine-readable snake_case code. Clients switch on this, never on `message`.
- `message` — human-readable explanation. May change between releases.
- `resets_at` — present only for rate-limit and quota errors. ISO 8601 UTC.
- `documentation` — deep link to the specific error in your docs site.

---

### 8.2 Response Headers

Every response includes a baseline set of headers. Some headers appear conditionally.

```
X-Api-Version: 1.0
X-Deprecation-Policy: https://docs.yourdomain.com/versioning
X-Data-Freshness: 2026-03-25T02:00:00Z
X-Data-Age-Hours: 22
X-Api-Key-Rotation-Required: true          # only when status='rotating_out'
X-Lookups-Remaining: 4823                   # v6: quota visibility
X-Lookups-Limit: 5000                       # v6: quota visibility
X-Billing-Note: not-metered                 # v6: on free endpoints like /inspections
```

Header notes:

- `X-Data-Freshness` — timestamp of the last successful pipeline run that refreshed the data behind this response.
- `X-Data-Age-Hours` — convenience integer so clients do not have to compute staleness themselves.
- `X-Api-Key-Rotation-Required` — only present when the calling key has `status='rotating_out'` in the `api_keys` table. Clients should treat this as a warning to rotate.
- `X-Lookups-Remaining` and `X-Lookups-Limit` — present on every metered endpoint response. Lets clients build quota dashboards without a separate call. # v6: quota visibility
- `X-Billing-Note: not-metered` — present on free endpoints (inspections, health, NAICS lookup) so clients know the call did not consume a lookup. # v6: quota visibility

---

### 8.3 GET /v1/employers — Primary Lookup

`# v6: finding #49 — path is plural /employers, not /employer`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1: was implicit; now explicit -->

This is the main search endpoint. It resolves a query (name, EIN, address) to an employer profile and returns the full compliance summary.

```
GET /v1/employers
  ?name=string       fuzzy match against canonical_name (pg_trgm)
  ?ein=string        exact match
  ?address=string    v6: finding #45 — free-text, parsed server-side by usaddress
  &naics=string      filter to 4-digit NAICS
  &state=string      filter to state
  &years=integer     1-5 window for summary counts (default 5)
  &confidence=string minimum confidence_tier: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
```

#### address_key Definition

`# v6: finding #46`

<!-- v6.2: Resolved libpostal vs usaddress inconsistency.
     Pipeline (parse_addresses.py) uses usaddress in Phase 1. libpostal is a Phase 2 upgrade.
     API search also uses usaddress. Same library at both ends ensures address_key consistency. -->

**Address parsing library:** Both the pipeline (`parse_addresses.py`) and the API search endpoint use **`usaddress`** (Python, pure-Python, no C dependencies). The architecture doc previously referenced `libpostal` in the pipeline Dockerfile — that is a **Phase 2 upgrade** for better international/edge-case handling. Phase 1 uses `usaddress` everywhere for consistency. The libpostal install block in the pipeline Dockerfile is commented out with a Phase 2 marker.

**Why consistency matters:** The `address_key` is used for exact-match joins. If the pipeline generates keys with libpostal and the API generates keys with usaddress, the same address will produce different keys and exact-match will silently fail.

**`address_key` canonical definition:**

The `address_key` is a pipe-delimited normalized string: **`STREET_NUMBER|STREET_NAME|ZIP5`**

Generation steps:
1. Parse raw address through `usaddress.tag()`
2. Extract `AddressNumber` (street number), `StreetName` + `StreetNamePostType` (street name), and `ZipCode` (first 5 digits)
3. Uppercase all components
4. Normalize street name: expand abbreviations (`ST` → `STREET`, `AVE` → `AVENUE`, `BLVD` → `BOULEVARD`, `DR` → `DRIVE`, `RD` → `ROAD`, `LN` → `LANE`, `CT` → `COURT`, `PL` → `PLACE`)
5. Concatenate with `|` separator

Example: `123 Main St, Suite 400, Boise, ID 83702` → `123|MAIN STREET|83702` (suite numbers are ignored).

**Failure modes:**
- If `usaddress.tag()` raises `RepeatedLabelError` (ambiguous parse): store `address_key = NULL`. The record participates in entity resolution via name/NAICS blocking only — it will not match on address.
- If any of the three required components (number, street, zip) are missing: store `address_key = NULL`.
- NULL `address_key` records are logged to pipeline monitoring as warnings (not errors).

This key is used during entity resolution in the pipeline and during search-time matching to boost results where the address matches exactly.

#### Ranking Priority Chain

`# v6: finding #37 — fixed`

The search engine applies these rules in strict priority order:

1. **EIN exact match** — definitive. If the query includes `?ein=` and a record matches, return it immediately. No fuzzy matching needed.
2. **address_key exact match AND name similarity > 0.90** — primary. If the parsed address_key matches a record exactly and the `pg_trgm` similarity between the query name and `canonical_name` exceeds 0.90, this is a strong match.
3. **pg_trgm similarity as primary rank.** Sort remaining candidates by trigram similarity score alone. `# v6: NOT multiplied by inspection count — that conflated relevance with data richness. An employer with 50 inspections and a 0.6 name similarity should not outrank an employer with 2 inspections and a 0.95 similarity.`
4. **Most recent `osha_last_inspection_date`** — tiebreaker only. When two candidates have identical similarity scores, the one with more recent inspection data ranks higher.

#### possible_matches

`# v6: finding #44`

When the top match is not definitive (i.e., not an EIN exact match), the response includes a `possible_matches` array. This array is capped at 10 results and paginated via `?matches_page=1&matches_per_page=10`. The `possible_matches_total` field tells the caller how many alternatives exist so they can paginate if needed.

#### No-Results Response

`# v6: finding #48 — return HTTP 404, not 200 with empty match`

When no employer matches the query, the API returns HTTP 404 with a structured body that includes data gap context. This prevents callers from silently treating a miss as a clean record.

```
HTTP 404
```

```json
{
  "found": false,
  "query": {"name": "SMITH ROOFING BOISE"},
  "compliance_summary": {
    "risk_tier": "UNKNOWN",
    "osha_inspection_count_5yr": 0
  },
  "data_gap_notes": [
    "No federal OSHA inspection records found.",
    "Zero inspection history is not confirmation of compliance.",
    "Employer may be in a state plan state or have no citation history."
  ]
}
```

### 8.4 Additional Endpoints

#### GET /v1/employers/{employer_id} — Direct Lookup

`# v6: finding #33 — the most fundamental REST gap in v5`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

This is the endpoint consumers call after resolving an employer via the search endpoint. The `employer_id` is a stable UUID that does not change across pipeline runs, making this endpoint cache-friendly and suitable for bookmarking.

```
GET /v1/employers/{employer_id}
  ?years=integer     1-5 window (default 5)
```

Returns the same response structure as the search endpoint `match` object, including all agency blocks, compliance_summary, provenance, and data_currency. The `possible_matches` array is omitted since the employer is already resolved.

---

#### GET /v1/employers/{employer_id}/risk-history — Risk Tier Over Time

`# v6: Phase 1 — snapshot queries`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

Returns historical risk tier snapshots for an employer, enabling trend analysis and audit trails. Each snapshot is created nightly by the pipeline and stored in the `risk_snapshots` table.

```
GET /v1/employers/{employer_id}/risk-history
  ?from_date=2024-01-01
  ?to_date=2026-03-01
  ?limit=100
```

Response:

```json
{
  "employer_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "canonical_name": "ACME ROOFING",
  "history": [
    {
      "snapshot_date": "2026-03-25",
      "risk_tier": "ELEVATED",
      "confidence_tier": "HIGH",
      "osha_inspection_count_5yr": 4,
      "osha_violation_count_5yr": 11,
      "osha_penalty_total_5yr": 47500,
      "violation_rate_trend": "DETERIORATING"
    },
    {
      "snapshot_date": "2026-02-25",
      "risk_tier": "MEDIUM",
      "confidence_tier": "HIGH",

      "violation_rate_trend": "STABLE"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### GET /v1/employers/{employer_id}/inspections — Inspection Detail

`# v6: employer_id replaces cluster_id; this endpoint is FREE`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
GET /v1/employers/{employer_id}/inspections
  ?page=1&per_page=25
  ?agency=OSHA|WHD|MSHA|OFCCP
  ?from_date=2020-01-01&to_date=2026-01-01
```

`# v6: finding #43 — this endpoint is FREE, not metered`

The response includes the header `X-Billing-Note: not-metered`. Inspection data is public record; charging for it adds friction without revenue justification. This endpoint reads from the `inspection_history` Postgres table, which is synced nightly from DuckDB silver.

<!-- v6.1: Response wrapped in pagination envelope — was raw array with no metadata -->

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {

#### GET /v1/industries/{naics4} — Industry Benchmark

`# v6: finding #49 — plural path /industries`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
GET /v1/industries/{naics4}
```

`# v6: NAICS validation — return 400 if invalid code`

If `naics4` does not match the pattern `/^\d{4}$/` or is not present in the `naics_2022` seed table, the API returns HTTP 400:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_naics_code",
  "message": "The code '99XX' is not a valid 4-digit NAICS code.",
  "valid_format": "4-digit NAICS code (e.g., 2382)"

#### GET /v1/industries/naics-codes — NAICS Code Lookup

`# v6: NAICS lookup and validation endpoint`

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

Helps callers discover valid NAICS codes before querying benchmarks.

```
GET /v1/industries/naics-codes
  ?sector=23       # optional filter by 2-digit sector
  ?search=roofing  # optional text search against descriptions
```

Response:

```json
{
  "codes": [
    {"naics_4digit": "2381", "description": "Foundation, Structure, and Building Exterior Contractors"},
    {"naics_4digit": "2382", "description": "Building Equipment Contractors"},
    {"naics_4digit": "2383", "description": "Building Finishing Contractors"}
  ]
}
```

---

#### POST /v1/employers/batch — Bulk Lookup

`# v6: finding #36 — async mode for large batches + higher cap`

Requires scope: `batch:write`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
POST /v1/employers/batch
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "lookups": [
    {"ein": "47-1234567"},
    {"name": "ACME ROOFING", "state": "ID"}
  ]
}
```

Two modes based on batch size:

- **≤25 items: synchronous.** Returns results immediately in the response body.
- **>25 items: async.** Returns a `job_id` for polling.
- **Hard cap: 500 items.** Over 500 returns HTTP 422 (not 413):

```json
{
  "error": "batch_too_large",
  "message": "Maximum 500 lookups per batch",
  "max": 500
}
```

<!-- v6.1: Standardized response key from "results" to "data" for consistency
     with inspections and subscriptions list endpoints. All list responses now use "data". -->

Synchronous response (≤25 items):

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"...match object...": ""},
    {"...match object...": ""}
  ],
  "items_total": 15,
  "items_found": 12
}
```

The sync response includes the header `X-Lookups-Consumed: 15`. `# v6: finding #42 — pricing: 1 lookup per item`

Async response (>25 items):

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "processing",
  "items_total": 200,
  "poll_url": "/v1/jobs/job_abc123",
  "estimated_seconds": 30

#### GET /v1/jobs/{job_id} — Async Batch Polling

`# v6: async batch polling endpoint`

Requires scope: `batch:write`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}
```

While processing:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "processing",
  "items_total": 200,
  "items_completed": 87
}
```

When complete:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "items_total": 200,
  "items_found": 178,
  "result_url": "https://r2.yourdomain.com/jobs/job_abc123.json",
  "expires_at": "2026-03-28T02:00:00Z"
}
```

Results are stored in R2 for 24 hours, then deleted automatically.

On failure:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Internal processing error"
}
```

---

#### POST /v1/employers/{employer_id}/feedback — User Feedback

Requires scope: `employer:read`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
POST /v1/employers/{employer_id}/feedback
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "type": "incorrect_match",
  "description": "These citations belong to a different employer",
  "contact_email": "optional@example.com"
}
```

Inserts into the `feedback` table and sends an alert email to ops. No metering. The `type` field accepts: `incorrect_match`, `missing_data`, `wrong_employer`, `other`.

Response (`201 Created`):

```json
{
  "feedback_id": "f1b2c3d4-...",
  "status": "received",
  "message": "Thank you for your feedback. Our team will review it."
}
```

---

#### GET /v1/health — System Health

Public endpoint — no authentication required. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
GET /v1/health
```

<!-- v6.2: Fully specified health check with pass/fail logic, used by deploy scripts,
     UptimeRobot, and post-pipeline cron. -->

**Pass/fail logic:** The endpoint returns HTTP 200 with `"status": "healthy"` if ALL of the following are true:
1. Postgres connection succeeds (query: `SELECT 1`)
2. `employer_profile` table has > 0 rows
3. Most recent `pipeline_runs` entry has `status IN ('completed', 'completed_with_warnings')`
4. Most recent pipeline run `finished_at` is within 26 hours of NOW() (allows for a missed nightly + buffer)

If any check fails, return HTTP 503 with `"status": "degraded"` and a `"checks"` object showing which check failed. Deploy scripts and UptimeRobot key on HTTP status code, not response body.

**Response (healthy — HTTP 200):**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "data_loaded": "ok",
    "pipeline_recent": "ok",
    "pipeline_status": "ok"
  },
  "last_pipeline_run": "2026-03-25T02:14:33Z",
  "last_pipeline_status": "completed",
  "employer_profiles_count": 1847293,
  "osha_data_effective_through": "~September 2025",
  "data_lag_note": "OSHA citations appear 3-8 months after inspection date",
  "api_version": "1.0"
}
```

**Response (degraded — HTTP 503):**

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "data_loaded": "ok",
    "pipeline_recent": "fail",
    "pipeline_status": "ok"
  },
  "message": "Pipeline has not completed in the last 26 hours",
  "last_pipeline_run": "2026-03-23T02:14:33Z",
  "api_version": "1.0"
}
```

No authentication required. No metering. Deploy rollback script (`deploy.sh`) checks for HTTP 200 — a 503 triggers automatic rollback to the previous image tag.

  "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/compliance",
  "events": ["risk_tier_change"]
}
```

Response (the `signing_secret` is shown exactly once, like API keys):

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "sub_xyz789",
  "signing_secret": "whsec_abc123...",
  "status": "active",
  "employer_ids_count": 2,
  "events": ["risk_tier_change"],
  "message": "Store the signing_secret securely. It will not be shown again."
}
```

Webhook payload (fired nightly after pipeline run, only when a watched employer's risk tier changes):

```
POST https://yourapp.com/webhooks/compliance
X-Signature: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of body using signing_secret>
```

```json
{
  "event": "risk_tier_change",
  "employer_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "canonical_name": "ACME ROOFING",
  "previous_risk_tier": "MEDIUM",
  "new_risk_tier": "ELEVATED",
  "snapshot_date": "2026-03-26",
  "details_url": "/v1/employers/a1b2c3d4-.../risk-history"
}
```

---

#### GET /v1/subscriptions — List Subscriptions

Requires scope: `subscriptions:manage`. <!-- v6.1 -->

<!-- v6.1: Added pagination params and envelope — was raw array -->

```
GET /v1/subscriptions
  ?page=1&per_page=25
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "subscription_id": "sub_xyz789",
      "employer_ids_count": 2,
      "events": ["risk_tier_change"],
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2026-03-20T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total": 3,
    "total_pages": 1
  }
}
```

---

#### PATCH /v1/subscriptions/{id} — Update Subscription

<!-- v6.1: was missing — customers had to delete and recreate (losing signing_secret) to change employer_ids -->

```
PATCH /v1/subscriptions/{sub_xyz789}
```

Requires scope: `subscriptions:manage`.

Request body (all fields optional — only provided fields are updated):

```json
{
  "employer_ids": ["a1b2c3d4-...", "e5f6a7b8-...", "new-id-..."],
  "events": ["risk_tier_change"],
  "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/v2/compliance",
  "status": "paused"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "sub_xyz789",
  "employer_ids_count": 3,
  "events": ["risk_tier_change"],
  "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/v2/compliance",
  "status": "paused",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-28T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Notes:
- The `signing_secret` is **not** regenerated on PATCH — this is the whole point. Use DELETE + POST to rotate the secret.
- `employer_ids` replaces the full list (not a merge). Send the complete set.
- `status` accepts `"active"` or `"paused"`. Paused subscriptions retain their config but skip webhook delivery.

---

#### DELETE /v1/subscriptions/{id} — Unsubscribe

Requires scope: `subscriptions:manage`. <!-- v6.1 -->

```
DELETE /v1/subscriptions/{sub_xyz789}
```

Returns `204 No Content`. The subscription is soft-deleted and webhook delivery stops immediately.

---

### 8.5 Dashboard Key Management Endpoints

<!-- v6.1: These were referenced in Section 5.3 (signup flow) but never formally specified
     with request/response schemas in Section 8. Now fully documented. -->

Dashboard endpoints use cookie-based JWT sessions (not `X-Api-Key`). All require an authenticated session with the `admin` or key-owner role. CSRF token required (see 6.2).

#### GET /dashboard/keys — List API Keys

```
GET /dashboard/keys
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "key_id": "kid_abc123",
      "name": "Production key",
      "key_prefix": "sk_live_abc1...",
      "status": "active",
      "scopes": ["employer:read", "batch:write"],
      "monthly_limit": 10000,
      "current_usage": 342,
      "expires_at": "2026-09-20T00:00:00Z",
      "created_at": "2026-03-20T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total": 2,
    "total_pages": 1
  }
}
```

Note: The raw key value is **never** returned after initial creation (finding #22).

---

#### POST /dashboard/keys — Generate New API Key

```
POST /dashboard/keys
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "CI/CD key",
  "scopes": ["employer:read", "batch:write"],
  "monthly_limit": 5000,
  "expires_in_days": 180
}
```

Response (key shown **once**, never retrievable again):

```json
{
  "key_id": "kid_def456",
  "raw_key": "sk_live_def456...",
  "name": "CI/CD key",
  "scopes": ["employer:read", "batch:write"],
  "monthly_limit": 5000,
  "expires_at": "2026-09-17T00:00:00Z",
  "message": "Store this key securely. It will not be shown again."
}
```

---

#### POST /dashboard/keys/{key_id}/rotate — Rotate Key

```
POST /dashboard/keys/{key_id}/rotate
```

Initiates NIST-compliant 48-hour rotation window. The old key continues working during the overlap.

Response (new key shown **once**):

```json
{
  "new_key_id": "kid_ghi789",
  "raw_key": "sk_live_ghi789...",
  "old_key_id": "kid_def456",
  "old_key_status": "rotating_out",
  "old_key_expires_at": "2026-03-30T14:00:00Z",
  "message": "Old key will continue working for 48 hours. Store the new key securely."
}
```

---

#### DELETE /dashboard/keys/{key_id} — Revoke Key

```
DELETE /dashboard/keys/{key_id}
```

Returns `204 No Content`. Key is immediately revoked (status set to `revoked`). Logged to `api_key_audit_log` (finding #29).

## 9. Monitoring, Testing, and Observability

### 9.1 Pipeline Health Monitor

Reads from Postgres now (finding #9):

```python
# pipeline/check_health.py (run via cron 30 8 * * *)
import asyncpg, asyncio, os

async def check():
    con = await asyncpg.connect(os.environ['PG_DSN'])
    row = await con.fetchrow("""
        SELECT completed_at, status, error_message
        FROM pipeline_runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1
    """)
    await con.close()

    if not row:
        send_alert('No pipeline runs recorded.')
        return
    if row['status'] != 'success':
        send_alert(f"Last pipeline run failed: {row['status']} — {row['error_message']}")
        return
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
    if row['completed_at'] < datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=26):
        send_alert(f"Pipeline stale since {row['completed_at']}")

def send_alert(msg: str):
    import requests
    # Send to configured alert channel (Slack webhook, email, etc.)
    webhook_url = os.environ.get('ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL')
    if webhook_url:
        requests.post(webhook_url, json={'text': f'PIPELINE ALERT: {msg}'})
    print(f'ALERT: {msg}')

asyncio.run(check())
```

## 11. Pricing & Go-To-Market

### 11.1 Pricing Model

| Tier | Monthly Price | Lookups/mo | Batch | Webhooks | Support |
|------|--------------|------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Free | $0 | 5 | No | No | Community |
| Starter | $500 | 5,000 | Sync (<=25) | No | Email |
| Growth | $2,000 | 25,000 | Async (<=500) | Yes | Priority email |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom | Yes | Dedicated |

**v6 additions:**

- **Free tier**: 5 lookups/month, no credit card required. Exists for developer evaluation. Sandbox (emp_test_ keys, 50 frozen employers) exists separately for integration testing. These are different things.
- **Batch pricing**: 1 lookup per item in the batch (not 1 per batch call).
- **Inspections endpoint**: Free, not metered. May become billable in future (X-Billing-Note: not-metered header).
- **Risk history endpoint**: Included in all paid tiers.
- **Webhooks**: Growth tier and above.

### 11.2 Cold Outreach

Build 10-employer demo set first. Demo profiles are the proof of value.

- LinkedIn: 'Predictive Analytics', 'Loss Analytics', 'Underwriting Data' at regional workers comp carriers.
- Target: Erie Insurance, ICW Group, EMPLOYERS Holdings, Meadowbrook, Society Insurance.
- Subject: 'OSHA citation history API — quick question'
- Email: one sentence description + link to yourdomain.com/demo + request for 20-minute call.
- Goal: 20 emails to 3 calls to 1 pilot.

### 11.3 Partnerships

- Avetta / ISNetworld / Veriforce — contractor prequalification platforms. They have the buyers; you have data they don't.
- Federato — explicitly named the OSHA manual lookup pain. Strong data integration partner candidate.
- Vanta / Drata / LogicGate — GRC platforms. OSHA employer module is a natural add-on.

### 11.4 Web UI Trigger

DECIDED: Replace Metabase with custom React UI when the first buyer says 'I need X and Metabase cannot do it.' Do not trigger on MRR or customer count alone.

## 12. Resolved Decisions Reference

Every architectural decision in v6, collected in one place so you never re-litigate.

| # | Decision | Chosen | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Pipeline DB | DuckDB | ETL/transformation workload; Postgres for serving |
| 2 | Serving DB | Postgres 16 | Relational, pg_trgm for fuzzy search, mature |
| 3 | Employer identifier | Stable UUID (employer_id) via cluster_id_mapping | Splink cluster_ids are transient; consumers need stable references |
| 4 | Password hashing | argon2id (time=3, mem=64MB, par=4) | OWASP 2024 / NIST SP 800-63B; memory-hard, resists GPU attacks |
| 5 | JWT signing | RS256 (asymmetric) | Private key signs, public key verifies; no shared secret risk |
| 6 | API key delivery | Show once in browser (OpenAI-style) | Email is not secure transport; keys never emailed |
| 7 | Nightly sync | Shadow-table swap | TRUNCATE+COPY takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock; swap is near-instant |
| 8 | Historical state | Snapshot pattern (append per pipeline run) | Simpler than SCD Type 2; enables risk-history endpoint |
| 9 | Server architecture | Two servers: pipeline (AX52, 64GB) + API (CPX31, 8GB) | Pipeline OOM can't kill API; ~€110/mo total |
| 10 | Deployment | Docker-native from day one | Atomic deploys, rollback = previous image tag, ACA migration path |
| 11 | Scale migration path | Azure Container Apps | Same Docker images, swap compose for ACA manifests |
| 12 | Webhooks | Phase 1, nightly diff, HMAC-SHA256 signed | Carriers need push; minimal viable: risk_tier_change events |
| 13 | Risk history | Phase 1, snapshot queries | PE/M&A buyers need trajectory, not point-in-time |
| 14 | Batch mode | Sync ≤25, async >25, cap 500 | Small callers get instant results; large batches don't block |
| 15 | Batch pricing | 1 lookup per item | Fair; prevents gaming via batch consolidation |
| 16 | Free tier | 5 lookups/month, no credit card | Developer evaluation; separate from sandbox (emp_test_ keys) |
| 17 | RBAC model | Role-based: viewer, analyst, admin | Simple; scopes on API keys for fine-grained control |
| 18 | Test keys | Route to test_fixtures table | 50 frozen employers; no quota consumption; isolated from production |
| 19 | Inspections pricing | Free, not metered | Low marginal cost; drives adoption of primary lookup |
| 20 | Backup sync | rclone copy (not sync) | sync deletes destination files if source is corrupted |
| 21 | Monitoring DB | Postgres (pipeline_runs table) | SQLite added unnecessary third DB engine with no concurrent-write safety |
| 22 | DuckDB memory (pipeline) | 40GB of 64GB | Pipeline server dedicated; leaves headroom for OS + Splink |
| 23 | Auth rate limiting | nginx: 10r/m on /auth/ endpoints | Prevents brute-force and credential stuffing |
| 24 | API key lookup | key_id UUID (not key_prefix) | key_prefix leaked entropy; UUID is independently generated |
| 25 | HTTP status for invalid key | 401 (not 403) | 403 leaks that the server recognized the caller |
| 26 | No-results response | HTTP 404 (not 200) | Consumers check status codes first |
| 27 | Endpoint naming | Plural (/v1/employers, /v1/industries) | REST convention consistency |
| 28 | Intermediate format | Binary COPY (not CSV) | CSV conflates NULL/empty, corrupts arrays with commas |
| 29 | Cron coordination | flock between pipeline and backup | Prevents backup capturing inconsistent DuckDB state |
| 30 | Metabase replacement trigger | First buyer says "I need X and Metabase cannot do it" | Don't over-build UI prematurely |

---

## 13. Known Data Quality Issues and Risks

### 13.1 Known Data Quality Issues

- **employee_count_est NULL for most small employers** — ITA filing required only for 250+ or 20-249 in high-hazard NAICS. industry_citation_rate falls back to Census CBP NAICS-level median when NULL.
- **Pre-2003 OSHA records frequently have NULL naics_code** — normalize to '0000' for blocking. Do not drop these records.
- **state_flag column in osha_inspection is NOT populated** — always use reporting_id 3rd digit for jurisdiction detection. Never use state_flag.
- **final_order_penalty updated on existing records after settlements** — dlt merge disposition handles this automatically.
- **DOL citation publication lag is 3-8 months** — always disclose via data_currency block in every API response.
- **NAICS 238170 = Roofing Contractors in 2022 NAICS** (was 238160 in 2017). OSHA data may contain both codes. Handle in normalization.
- **FMCSA property carrier Crash Indicator and Hazardous Materials BASICs are hidden** from public data per the FAST Act of 2015. Inspections and violation counts remain public.
- **v6: Splink model drift risk** — thresholds (0.80/0.85) may degrade as data volume grows. Monitored via precision/recall tracking against labeled holdout set per pipeline run. Alert if precision drops below 0.85.
- **v6: Multi-geography employers** — Splink zip5 blocking misses multi-location employers. Mitigated by adding name+NAICS blocking rule (finding #11).

### 13.2 Key Risks

- **DOL API has no SLA** — can go down during government shutdowns. Mitigation: bronze layer isolation (API outage only affects freshness), CSV fallback path.
- **Splink EM finds local optima** — validate against 200-500 hand-labeled pairs before running on full corpus. Review queue captures training pairs over time.
- **Data disk failure** — all bronze Parquet is replicated to Cloudflare R2 nightly (rclone copy). DuckDB rebuilds from bronze in 3-4 hours. Postgres restores from daily dump in 15-30 minutes.
- **Legal liability** — data accuracy disclaimer in ToS before first paying customer. DOL data has known quality issues; buyers are responsible for their own decisions.
- **Entity resolution errors** will occur for common business names (ABC Construction). confidence_tier system and review queue make uncertainty explicit and improvable over time.
- **v6: Snapshot storage growth** — keeping N days of employer_profile snapshots increases storage linearly. Implement retention policy: daily snapshots for 90 days, weekly for 1 year, monthly for 3 years. Estimated storage: ~500MB/snapshot × 365 days = ~180GB/year at full scale.
- **v6: Docker registry dependency** — if container registry is down, deploys are blocked. Mitigate with local image cache on servers (`docker compose pull` caches images locally).
- **v6: Two-server network partition** — if pipeline server can't reach API server's Postgres, sync fails silently. Mitigate with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff) and Slack/email alerting on sync failure.
- **v6: R2 batch results expiry** — async batch results stored in R2 expire after 24h. Callers must download promptly. Document this clearly in API docs.

### 13.3 Moat Summary

The moat is not data access — DOL data is public. The moat is:

1. **Entity resolution quality** built from years of labeled review queue decisions
2. **The WHD→OSHA EIN bridge** that only exists after running the pipeline for months
3. **Longitudinal employer history** a late entrant cannot reconstruct without running from 1972 forward
4. **Multi-source synthesis** no competitor currently combines
5. **Corporate hierarchy linkages** built over time

Build the review queue from day one. Every human decision logged is a training pair that compounds.
